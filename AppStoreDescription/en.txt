Pi-hole Remote is a third party Pi-hole application that lets you quickly enable/disable your Pi-hole, as well as add domains to your whitelist/blacklist and view statistics such as top allowed and blocked domains!

*Disable Blocking*
Quickly disable blocking for a few minutes with only a few taps. You can even use Siri Shortcuts to disable blocking with your voice! If you have multiple instances, you can disable blocking for all of them with one tap.

*Statistics & Queries*
Look up what domains are queried most on your network, as well as clients that send out the most requests. See queries sorted by domain, client, or type. You can even view a Live Log that shows requests in real-time!

*White & Blacklist*
Quickly add new entries to your lists inside the app or with the iOS Share Extension. You can also add entries in bulk and export list entries. If you have two Pi-hole instances, you can even automatically sync your lists!

*Homescreen Widgets (iOS 14)*
Choose from a wide range of homescreen widgets that show statistics or a query-graph. All are customisable with a wide range of options!

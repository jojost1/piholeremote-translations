Pi-hole Remote is a third party Pi-hole application that lets you quickly enable/disable your Pi-hole, as well as add domains to your whitelist/blacklist and view statistics such as top allowed and blocked domains!

*Disable Blocking*
Quickly disable blocking for a few minutes with only a few taps. You can even use Siri Shortcuts to disable blocking with your voice! If you have multiple instances, you can disable blocking for all of them with one tap.

*Statistics & Queries*
Look up what domains are queried most on your network, as well as clients that send out the most requests. See queries sorted by domain, client, or type. You can even view a Live Log that shows requests in real-time!

*Blocked Services*
Want to quickly restrict access to Facebook, YouTube, Snapchat, and more? Block all kinds of services effortlessly with just one tap.

*White & Blacklist*
Quickly add new entries to your lists inside the app or with the iOS Share Extension. You can also add entries in bulk and export list entries. If you have two Pi-hole instances, you can even automatically sync your lists!

*Local DNS*
Manage your Local DNS and CNAME records, right from the app!

*Interactive Widgets & Live Activity*
Choose from a wide range of homescreen and lock screen widgets that show statistics or graphs. There are also interactive widgets to disable blocking without opening the app! When you disable blocking, you will even see a Live Activity on your lock screen and Dynamic Island.

*Full Ecosystem*
Purchase the app once and get access to the iOS, watchOS, iPadOS, macOS, and tvOS app.

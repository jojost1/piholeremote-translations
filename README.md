Repository tracking translations for Pi-hole Remote

## How to help translate
In order to help translate, you will need to be able to download Xcode (from the Mac App Store). With Xcode downloaded, you can open one of the `.xcloc` files in the 'App Strings' folder and an editor will open which shows the keys with English translation, comment, and a textfield for the translated language.

## Priority
The 'App Strings' folder contains all strings to be translated. Most important are 'Pi-hole Remote > Localization > Localizable' and 'Pi-hole Remote > Localization > InfoPlist', you'll see these when you open the file with Xcode. After this, the next most important thing is the AppStore Description. The other files have a lower priority.

## Adding a new language
Please open an issue and I'll add the required files for the language. After that, you can create a pull request and commit changes to the files in your language.

## Modifying translations
You can modify existing translations when you think something can be improved, please make the changes and open a pull request.
